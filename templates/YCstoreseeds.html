      <h2>Step 15: Secure Your Seed Packets</h2>
      <ul>
          <li>Each seed packet should contain one of the paper packets your printed that now contains your hand written seed words and the corresponding USB drive that contains the same seed words.</li>
          <li>Secure the paper packets in their permanent storage location before you click Next to continue.</li>
          <li>Take the following required steps to comply with yeticold cold storage (these apply to everyone) when storing your seed packets:</li>
          <ul>
              <li>Ensure they are physically distributed so that a single disaster will not destroy more than 3 of them.</li>
              <li>Ensure they are in sealed envelopes that do not indicate they are bitcoin related. "Estate plan," for example indicates the paperwork is important, but relatively uninteresting for a thief.</li>
              <li>Ensure they do not contain anything physically interesting and might attract attackers. Steel cylinders with your seed words may draw attention from potential attackers.</li>
              <li>Ensure they are stored with people that do not know they are bitcoin related. Storing a key with a service/company that provides key storage introduces many risks.</li>
              <li>Ensure no more than two keys are stored in bank safe deposit boxes.</li>
              <li>Ensure no more than two keys are stored at any physical location including your home.</li>
              <li>If you mail keys, ensure no more than one is sent with a given carrier and do not mail more than two.</li>
              <li>Always keep your USB device and your paper seed words in the same location. Separating them increases the risk of theft.</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Consider taking the following optional precautions (for many people these steps introduce needless difficulty and risk):</li>
          <ul>
              <li>Distribute keys so that a plane trip is required for recovery.</li>
              <li>Have a plausible amount of bitcoin to provide in a ransom situation that is not part of your yeticold storage.</li>
              <li>Store keys only with people that do not know one another. For example your CPA and your Lawyer could collude if they know each other.</li>
              <li>Store your seed packets in tamper evident envelopes with serial numbers imprinted by the manufacturer inside your uninteresting envelope.</li>
          </ul>
      </ul>
