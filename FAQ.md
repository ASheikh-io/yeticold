### How much knowledge of Linux is required?
None. Installing Ubuntu is the only challenging task and it is no more difficult than installing Windows or Mac OS. Even if you have never installed an OS before it is not difficult and you can get support from our slack channel at:

You can also hire a local computer shop to install Ubuntu for you for about $30 and as long as they don't suspect you will use this laptop for bitcoin it is a reasonably safe option.

### How much time does it take to set up the first time?
The most time consuming part of yeti is waiting for bitcoin core to sync with the network. With an SSD drive this can be done overnight, but if you have an HDD (old style) drive it could take up to a week.

For the part where you are actually doing something it takes less than an hour.

### Does it make sense to get a faster laptop to speed up the process?
Probably not as you will only work with yeti a couple times a year so you won't get a ton of use out of faster hardware. However, an SSD drive is about $50 and makes syncing much faster so if you are a bitcoin enthusiast and you like to test and experiment with bitcoin core it is worth doing.

### What are the minimum specs for the laptops?
A laptop(s) that can run Ubuntu and Bitcoin Core is required. At the time of this writing almost any laptop will work but if your laptop has an SSD type hard drive some steps will take a few hours instead of a few days. Laptops without SSD type drives cost about $150 USD and laptops with SSD drives cost about $200 USD.

### Why do I need a printer?
You only need a printer for Level 3 and it is used to print out recovery instructions. The printer will be used to print your seed words.

### What kind of CDs should I buy?
You don't need to buy any special type of CDs. For Level 1 and Level 2 you will have multiple copies of any important data stored on CDs and Level 3 you also have a paper backup in case your CDs are lost or damaged. All CDs are much better storage devices than any USB or hardware wallet storage devices because a laser is used to 
burn a thin piece of plastic to store a 1 or 0 instead of a tiny amount of electrical charge. This is much more reliable for long term storage.

### When using Level 3 it requires two laptops, do the laptops need to be the same?
No. Any laptops that can run Ubuntu and Bitcoin core will work great.

### What USB sticks are good to get?
Any cheap USB sticks will work fine. 

### Should I try to get a laptop without wifi?
No. Yeti disables your network connections before generating your seed words. It couldn't hurt to have a laptop without wifi or only use your Ethernet port for added assurance, but it's probably not worth the hassle.

### How can I make sure my seed phrases are safe?
When you follow the instructions in Yeti you will store your seed words in places like safety deposit boxes and home safes. For Level 2 and Level 3 an attacker would need to gain access to 3 of those locations so securing your seed words is much easier. 

### How is this better than a hardware wallet?
Hardware wallets can be very easy to use because people believe that they are safe even when they plug them into insecure devices like a daily driver laptop. This is false, but it does create an easy user experience that is fine for smaller amounts. This also means it is very easy to regularly spend from these devices. However for smaller amounts it is cheaper, safer and easier to use a single purpose phone using bluewallet.io than to use a hardware wallet so there is really no circumstance where a hardware wallet is appropriate.

To learn more about why hardware wallets are always the wrong choice see Robert Spigler's comprehensive review of hardware wallets:

### How is using a laptop better than a hardware wallet?
Generic computing hardware is used. Hardware sold specifically for bitcoin storage requires trusting everyone from manufacturing to shipping to fail to realize the opportunity available to modify the hardware in order to steal bitcoin.

When you use a hardware wallet you are trusting the small team of people that write and review the code and everyone that has handled the hardware wallet before you got it. With yeti all important security functions are handled by bitcoin core and it has the best developers and the largest number of people checking for errors. 

You are also using Ubuntu and a generic laptop, but this is more secure as Ubuntu is reviewed by hundreds of developers for security issues and generic hardware makes "supply chain attacks" much more expensive.

### What's a good strategy for storing the seeds?
Always store your seeds with people and locations that do not know they are storing bitcoin seeds. For example your lawyer should believe he is storing "just another important legal document." You should also ensure you seeds are geographically distributed so that you will not lose access to at least 3 of them after a large natural disaster. 

### How can I be sure my seed is random? 
Yeti uses Bitcoin Core to generate your randomness. This is the most trustworthy software so it is the only choice for storing significant amounts of bitcoin.

### Is it dangerous to have all the seeds required for spending on the same laptop at the same time?
No. For Yeti Level 1 and Level 2 you are using a dedicated laptop that has no other software installed outside bitcoin core. This makes it very difficult for an attacker. Seeds are also only on the laptop for a short period of time when spending and then the laptops are erased. For Level 3 seeds are never on a laptop that is internet connected. Level 3 is appropriate for up to 10M USD (in 2018 purchasing power). For amounts over 10M USD Level 4 is under development and will require additional hardware so that two seeds are never on the same device.

### Does Yeti Use Seed Words?
Yes. We use the WIF format and NATO words to make writing down seed words stress free.

### Why doesn't Yeti use Bip39 for Seed Words?
Bip39 is not supported by Bitcoin Core. The bip itself shows that the status of the proposal is that it is "Unanimously Discouraged for Implementation." The reasons for rejecting it fall into two categories. First there are concerns about the cryptographic algorithms used. While the Yeti developers do not understand the details of these concerns because we are not cryptographers we don't see the logic in accepting the risk of using a controversial proposal without gaining any benefit. 

The second set of concerns is around the need to store mappings of words to numbers used in seeds to spend your bitcoin. This is even worse because every human language needs to have a different dictionary and if any of those mappings of words to numbers is lost or corrupted those users will lose all of their stored bitcoin. 

Another problem with bip39 that was of particular concern to Yeti contributors is that some of the words in bip39 look similar to one another when hand written. This could create a false sense of security for users that could cause them to lose bitcoin where it would actually be better to have users hand write the letters and numbers they have already learned can be confused for one another.

To solve these problems the Yeti contributors decided that the best solution is to use the well established WIF standard that looks like "abc123" and simply translate those letters and numbers into "alpha bravo charlie ONE TWO THREE." This prevents all of the problems with Bip39. There are no mappings to be lost, the words are very difficult to confuse for other words and the only algorithms involved are universally approved by the smartest cryptographers in bitcoin.
