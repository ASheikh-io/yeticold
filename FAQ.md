## Basics

### How much knowledge of Linux is required?

### How much time does it take to set up the first time?

## Hardware

### Does it make sense to get a faster laptop to speed up the process?

### What are the minimum specs for the laptops?

### When going for a setup with 2 laptops, do the laptops need to be the same?

No.

### What USB sticks are good to get?

Minimum size...

### Should I try to get a laptop without wifi?

## Seed

### How to make sure my seed phrases are safe?

### What about the evil maid attack?

### How is this better than a hardware wallet?

Generic computing hardware is used. Hardware sold specifically for bitcoin storage requires trusting everyone from manufacturing to shipping to fail to realize the opportunity available to modify the hardware in order to steal bitcoin.

Also, over time, thieves will become aware of what hardware wallets look like. An old laptop will not immediately get someone with bad intentions to think it's related to bitcoin.

### How is this worse than a hardware wallet?

It's more complex to set up. It takes more time and planning. If you want to quickly secure your coins a hardware wallet like Trezor or Coldcard can be a good idea. If you don't feel comfortable anymore storing the value in your hardware wallet YetiCold is a great idea.

### What's a good strategy for storing the seeds?

You can keep more than 1 key in one location. With a 3 out of 7 setup you should never have 3 keys in one location unless you want to transfer. So you need at least 4 locations, one of these can be your home. Other ideas:
- Hire a vault with a bank.
- Your office.
- Store with good friends or family members.

As opposed to a hardware wallet, a simple USB stick will not immediately look like it might contain a lot of value. This is both an advantage and a disadvantage.

### What's the real world risk with having 10MM and only using a Trezor, no multi sig?

The biggest is loss if you don’t have seeds in many locations. The next is theft of a seed phrase. And the next is the risk that your seed isn’t random.

### How can I be sure my seed is random? Can you elaborate on that?

Use bitcoin core to generate your randomness.

And use mulisig so that even if some of your seeds are stolen the bitcoin remains safe.

### The random keys core puts out I can convert into 12 words can't I? Isn't it the same? Wouldn't we just be arguing the randomness of then those 12 words?

You should trust https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin  to create your random words that secure your bitcoin more than anything else.
